### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jagbiryadav/chatgpt-clone.git
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser

3. On first launch, you'll be prompted to enter your name and optionally your Gemini API key

### Usage

1. **Starting a Chat**: Enter your message in the input field at the bottom and press Enter or click Send
2. **New Chat**: Click the "New chat" button in the sidebar
3. **Switching Chats**: Click on any previous chat in the sidebar to resume it
4. **Attaching Files**: Click the paperclip icon to upload images or documents
5. **Changing Themes**: Press `Ctrl+D` to toggle between light and dark mode
6. **Managing Chats**: Use the rename and delete buttons on each chat item

## API Integration

This project can work with the Gemini API for real AI responses:

1. Get your free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Enter your API key in the profile settings or during onboarding
3. The app will automatically use the API for responses

**Note**: Due to browser security restrictions (CORS), direct API calls may not work in all browsers. The app includes a simulated response mode that works without an API key.
